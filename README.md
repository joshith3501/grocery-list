# ABOUT PROJECT
This is a simple project made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# DESCRIPTION

The well known version of this project is To-Do List. I've implemented this project using vanilla Javascript.

we simply add an element by typing it into the input box.
every item we add, is gonna be displayed.

Each Item has two actions possible. 
- Edit
- delete

you can edit and update the item. 
or you can delete it.

At last we can clear all the items with the 'clear all' button

**Still had to add the complete action for an item.**

# Remarks 

- The hardest part of this project (probably) is making the item available for editing. 
I struggled a lot with implementing this feature. There might be a better way of implementation than the one I used.
